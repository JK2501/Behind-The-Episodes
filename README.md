# Mobile Tab Selection

This branch is used to test a new approach to switch between the 
episode catalogue and the selected episode. 

It makes use of the new `:has` selector inside CSS.

When it is compatible across all major browsers this feature will be merged into `main` branch.
As of yet, Firefox does not allow `:has` natively.

(See [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has) for `:has` support across all browsers.)
